# Genetic Algorithms for IoT
In the last chapter, we saw different deep learning-based algorithms, these algorithms have shown their success in the field of recognition, detection, reconstruction and even generation of vision, speech and text data. While at present deep learning is on top in terms of both application and employability, it has a close competition with evolutionary algorithms. The Algorithms inspired by the natural process of evolution, the world's best optimizers. Yep, even we are the result of years of genetic evolution. In this chapter, you will be introduced to the fascinating world of evolutionary algorithms and learn about a specific type of evolutionary algorithms, i.e. genetic algorithms in more detail. After reading this chapter you will:

* Know what is optimization.
* Will learn different methods to solve an optimization problem.
* Understand the intuition behind genetic algorithms
* Know about the advantages of genetic algorithms
* Understand and implement the process of cross-over, mutation and fitness function selection.
* Use a genetic algorithm to find the lost password.
* Learn about various uses of genetic algorithm in optimizing your models.
* Learn the DEAP genetic algorithm library
