# Chapter 1: Principles and foundations of IoT and  AI
This book deals with the three big trends in the current Business Scenario, __Internet of things (IoT)__, __big data__ and __artificial intelligence (AI)__. The exponential growth of the number of devices connected to the internet and the exponential volume of data created by them necessitates the need of using the analytical and predictive techniques of artificial intelligence and deep learning. This book specifically targets the third component, the various analytical and predictive methods/models available in the field of AI for the big data generated by IoT.
This chapter will briefly introduce you to these three trends and will expand on how they are interdependent. The data generated by IoT devices is uploaded to the cloud, thus you will also be introduced to the various IoT cloud platforms and the data services they offer. The chapter will cover the following points:

* Knowing what is a thing in IoT, what devices constitute things, what are the different IoT Platforms, and what is an IoT verticals.
* Know what is big data, understand how the amount of data generated by IoT lies in the range of big data. 
* Understand how and why AI can be useful for making sense of the voluminous data generated by IoT.
* With the help of an illustration, understand how IoT, big data and AI together can help shape a better world.
* And finally, learn about some of the tools that would be needed to perform the analysis.
