Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have touched almost all fields related to man. Agriculture, music, health, defence, you will not find a single field where AI has not leave its mark. The enormous success of AI/ML, besides the presence of computational powers, also depends on the generation of a significant amount of data. Majority of the data generated is unlabelled, and thus understanding the inherent distribution of the data is an important ML task. It is here that Generative Models come into the picture.

In past few years, deep Generative models have shown great success in understanding the data distribution and have been used in a variety of applications. Two of the most popular generative models are Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

In this chapter, we will learn about both VAEs and GANs and use them to generate images. After reading the chapter, you will:

* Know the difference between generative networks and discriminative networks.
* Learn about Variational Autoencoders
* Understand the intuitive functioning of Generative Adversarial Networks
* Implement the Vanilla GAN and use it to generate handwritten digits.
* Know the most popular variation of GAN, the DCGAN
* Implement DCGAN in TensorFlow and use it to generate faces.
* Know further variations and applications of GAN.
