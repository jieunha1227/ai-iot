Now that you are fully equipped with machine learning and deep learning knowledge, and have learned how to use it for big data, image tasks, text task and time series data. It is the time to explore some real uses of the algorithms and the techniques that you have learned. This chapter and the following two chapters will now concentrate on some specific case studies. This chapter will focus on personal and home IoT use-cases. After going through the chapter you will:

* Know about the successful IoT applications.
* Learn about wearables and their role in personal IoT.
* Learn how to monitor heart using machine learning.
* Understand what makes home "smart home".
* Learn about some devices used in smart home
* Explore the application of AI in predicting human activity recognition
