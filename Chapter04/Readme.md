# Deep Learning for IoT
In the last chapter, we learned about different machine learning algorithms, the focus of this chapter is the neural network based multiple layered models a.k.a. Deep learning models. They have become the buzzword in the last few years, and an absolute favourite of Investors in the field of Artificial-Intelligence-based startups. Achieving above human level accuracy in the task of object detection, defeating the world's Dan Nine Go master are some of the feats possible by deep learning. In this chapter and few subsequent chapters, we will learn about the different deep learning models and how to use deep learning on our IoT generated data. In this chapter, we will start with a glimpse to the journey of deep learning, and learn about four popular models, the multilayered perceptron (MLP), the convolution neural networks (CNN), Recurrent neural network (RNN) and Autoencoders. Specifically, you will:

* Know about the history of deep learning and the factors responsible for its present success.
* Know about an artificial neuron, and how they can be connected  to solve non-linear problems.
* Know about the backpropagation algorithm and use it to train the MLP model.
* Learn about the different optimizers and activation functions available in TensorFlow.
* Know how the convolutional neural network works, and the concept behind kernel, padding and strides.
* Use CNN model for classification/recognition..
* Know about the recurrent neural networks and the modified RNNs, the Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units.
* Know the architecture and functioning of Autoencoders.
