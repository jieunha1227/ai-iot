Now that we have understood and implemented different Artificial Intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) algorithms, it is time to combine it all together, understand which type of data is best suited for each and at the same time understand the basic pre-processing required for each type of data. By the end of this chapter you will:

* Know the different types of data that can be fed to your model
* Learn how to process time series data
* Pre-processing of textual data
* Different transforms that can be done on image data
* How to handle video files
* How to handle speech data
* Cloud computing options
