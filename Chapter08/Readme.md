The advances in distributed computing environments and an easy availability of internet worldwide has resulted in the emergence of Distributed AI. In this chapter, we will learn about two frameworks one by Apache the MLLib and another H2O.ai, both provide distributed and scalable machine learning for large, streaming data. The chapter will start with an introduction to Apache's Spark the defacto distributed data processing system.  By the end of the chapter you will:

* Know about Spark and its importance in distributed data processing
* Understand the Spark architecture
* Learn about MLLib
* Use MLLib in your deep learning pipeline
* Delve deep into H2O.ai platform
