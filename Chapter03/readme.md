# Machine Learning for IoT
The term "machine learning" refers to the computer programs that can automatically detect meaningful patterns in data and improve with experience. Though it is not a new field, it is presently at the peak of its hype cycle. This chapter introduces the readers to the standard machine learning algorithms and their applications in the field of IoT.  After reading this chapter you will:

* Know what machine learning is and the role it plays in IoT pipeline.
* Know about the supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms
* Know about regression and learn how to perform linear regression using TensorFlow/Keras
* Know about popular machine learning classifiers and implement them in TensorFlow/Keras
* Know about Decision Trees, Random Forests and techniques to perform boosting. We will also learn how to write code for them.
