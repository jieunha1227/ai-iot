Reinforcement Learning is very different from both supervised and unsupervised learning. It is the way most living beings learn - interacting with the environment.  In this chapter, we will study different algorithms employed for reinforcement learning. As you will progress through the chapter, you will:

* Know what is reinforcement learning, and how it is different from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 
* Know different elements of reinforcement learning.
* Learn about some fascinating applications of RL in the real world.
* Understand the OpenAI interface for training RL agents.
* Know about Q-learning and use it to train an RL agent.
* Know about Deep Q Networks and employ them to train an agent to play Atari.
* Know about Policy Gradient algorithm and use it to
